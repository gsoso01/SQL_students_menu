# FCED-DB Project

This is a comprehensive project that involves designing a relational database, creating a Python script to clean and populate the database from a provided CSV file, and building an interactive menu-driven user interface for easy data access and manipulation. This project streamlines the management of  data, making it easier to work with the information acquired.

From the database provided (SQL file in `data` folder), we've implemented the following relational model:

Student(<u>email</u>, first_name[NN], last_name[NN], date_of_birth, gpa, state)
Course(<u>course_name</u>)
Building(<u>building_name</u>)
Exam(<u>exam_id</u>, exam_date[NN], #exam_name -> Type [NN], #course_name -> Course [NN])
Room(<u>room_name</u>, capacity, has_projector, has_computers, is_accessible, #building_name -> Building [NN])
Type(<u>exam_name</u>)
ExamAttempt(<u>#email -> Student [NN]</u>, <u>#exam_id -> Exam [NN]</u>, #room_name -> Room [NN], grade)
is_enrolled(<u>#email -> Student</u>, <u>#course_name -> Course</u>)

The UML diagram of this model in shown below.

## Usage

 1. Have  [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) installed either in your computer or in a cloud environment;
 2. Create a database  and using the Query Tool, run the code inside of **grades.sql**;
 3. Make sure you have all the Python requirements running `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install them all;
 4. Access your PostgreSQL database connection credentials using the Properties menu;
 5. Update the `DB_PARAMS` of the  **load_grades.py** code with them correctly. Make sure the variable `csv_file_path` contains the correct path to the `grades.csv` file. Now you can run it;
 6. Repeat step 5 with the **grades.py** file and run it. Now you can access the database interactively ;
 7. Remember to maintain all the codes in the same folder as they might import methods from each other;
